# nosql-challenge

This challgenge was completed using Jupyter notebook. I importated the following libraries to complete analysis:
pymongo, pprint, and pandas


For this challenge, I created the database 'uk_foods.' Within this database, I created the collection 'establishments' and imported the json file, which contained data on over 39,000 establishments.
The setup for this challenge included updating the database to include a new restaurant. I also deleted entries where the city name was Dover.
For the analysis, I queried the data to find results that matched certain paramaters (eg, hygiene score of 20), and converted the results into Data Frames. by determining the length of the dataframe, I could determine how many establishments matched the parameters.



Please note that I was unable to upload the Resources folder, as the .json file was too large to upload onto github
